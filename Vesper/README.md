## Summary of the project
Vesper was a 7 weeks game project that was pitched by my class mate at Yrgo 
## About

Vesper is a skill-based puzzle platformer where you play as a formless celestial being
that has been trapped in a physical form. Use the ability to change sizes to find your way home.

## Main Mechanics 
As a 2D fast paced platformer, one of the most important main mechanics is the
*player movement*, *changing* sizes and the *particle system*. I was mostly responsible of the implementation of these mechanincs. 

###   - Player Movement
Off course the player movement consumed most of my time in order to perfect it in a way that it is as smooth as it is now.
The Player mechanics are the largest mechanic in the game. I coverd the movement part, focusing on the input-precision and the difference in 
stats of each size that player character has (Three, <Big, Medium, Small>).
