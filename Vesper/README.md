## Summary of the project
Vesper was a 7 weeks game project that was pitched by my classmate at Yrgo 
## About

Vesper is a skill-based puzzle platformer where you play as a formless celestial being
that has been trapped in a physical form. Use the ability to change sizes to find your way home.

## Main Mechanics 
As a 2D fast-paced platformer, one of the most important main mechanics is the
*player movement*, *changing* sizes, and the *particle system*. I was mostly responsible for the implementation of these mechanisms. 

###   - Player Movement
Of course, the player movement consumed most of my time to perfect it in a way that was as smooth as it is now;
this is how it began.

However, after hard work and better code implementation;

The Player mechanics are the largest mechanic in the game. I covered the movement part, focusing on the input precision and the difference in 
stats of each size the player character has (Three: <Big, Medium, Small>).
